# Comparing-NYC-and-Toronto
Introduction/Business Problem 

In this problem, I will try to compare neighborhoods of NYC and Toronto, how similar or dissimilar they are. Both the cities 
are the largest cities and the financial capital of their respective countries. They can be compared based on a lot of things 
like number of tourist attractions, or restaurants etc. Or who has the better bars. For this particular problem, I'll be comparing who has the better restuarants. This problem can be interesting to someone who wants to know which city has better restaurants or if someone wants to open a new restaurant in one of this cities.       


For this problem, I will be using Foursqaure's Places API which has the data for tens of thousands of places around the world and features like venue category and popularity.


Data 

For a list of Toronto neighborhoods, I'll be scrapping Wikipedia using beautiful soup. ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M')

And for NYC neighborhoods, I'll be using data provided by NYU.
