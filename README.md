# Types of Bars and Restuarants in NYC.
Introduction/Business Problem 

In this problem, I will try to find out where should a person open a Bar/Resturant in NYC depending on the borough. For a business, it is really important to know the market where you are planning to open your business. What the market likes or does not like, knowing or not knowing these things can make or break the business. NYC is well known for its Resturants and Bars, let's see the types of Restuarants and Bars in each borough.

For this problem, I will be using Foursqaure's Places API which has the data for tens of thousands of places around the world and features like venue category and popularity.


Data 

For NYC neighborhoods, I'll be using data provided by NYU.
(https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572).
I have also uploaded the json file.
