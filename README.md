# Comparing-NYC-and-Toronto
Introduction/Business Problem 

In this problem, I will try to compare neighborhoods of NYC and Toronto, how similar or dissimilar they are. Both the cities 
are the largest cities and the financial capital of their respective countries. They can be compared based on a lot of things 
like number of tourist attractions, or restaurants etc. Or who has the better bars. For this problem, I will be using 
Foursqaure's Places API which has the data for tens of thousands of places around the world and features like venue category 
and popularity.
